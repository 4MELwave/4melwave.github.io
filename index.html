<p class="t0">hi there! i'm MEL. welcome to my website!</p>
<div class="txb">
    <p>

        i've made this site for a couple of reasons, which i will discuss in detail at a later time; the most important reason, however, can be summarized as follows: i don't humanize myself enough on my digital platform. i don't talk about my interests, fears, aspirations, and day-to-day thoughts on social media because i don't feel that it's an appropriate or well-suited place to do so. i am but a regular human being, and i want to provide some proof of that. so here we are.
        <br>
        <br>
        additionally, social media access is currently in question here in the U.S., so i figured now would be a good a time as ever to get this project off the ground.

<br>
<div class="t2">What will this site be for?</div>
<div class="txb">
    <p>
        a lot of this site will be me posting about what you already see: latex and cosplay. There's a lot that goes into making these shoots happen, so i'd like to discuss in depth about that process.
        <br><br>
        i'll also be discussing my other projects; stuff like game/general dev, music, photography, writing, etc., as well as a bunch of other weird little hobbies and things i do.
        <br><br>
        there will be a section in which i do traditional blog posts where i can talk aimlessly about random crap like what happened to me today or about whatever.
        <br><br>
        another section i'll dedicate to long-form writings in which i discuss my general outlook on things like life 3d wizard gifs. this is the rant section.
        <br><br>
        the architecture of the site depends on how i want to organize the above, and i haven't really figured that out yet either, so stay tuned. 
    </p>
</div>
<div class="t2">Are you selling something?</div>
<div class="txb">
    <p>
        no. 
        <br><br>
        and for personal reasons, i never will; though i should clarify i have no problem with others electing to do so. "selling" things includes "content" like OF pics/requests, or products like outfits. i will never sell you anything, and if i am, then i've either finally lost it completely or you're dealling with a scammer.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="t2">Can I interact with you directly through this site?</div>
<div class="txb">
    <p>
        no. this site is, by design, strictly static; in other words, it is functionally read-only. you will not be able to comment on this site, or send me a message through it. this is largely for security reasons. i am still thinking about a long-term way how to allow the user to interact with me (likely through an existing service).
        <br><br>
        but, that isn't to say i love to chat! currently, i still readily communicate through my existing socials. i may put up my discord later. if you'd like to reach out, please do so through there; and as usual, please be respectful! i will not respond to messages without clear intent or discussion topic. i don't talk about kink stuff with other people on the internet, unless it's about a collab.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="t2">Why does this site look so basic?</div>
<div class="txb">
    <p>
        this is intentional and will not be going away. lining up with some other projects i have, i will be desiging this website to be as backwards-compatible as possible with older operating systems and browsers. i have taken specific precautions to make sure the JS and CSS work on these older systems; currently, things should work correctly as far back as IE5 on Windows 2000. Spin up a Vm and try it for yourself!
        <br><br>
        as i type currently, i am punching in words into an html file in vscodium. lol. i am taking the path of the weird annoying contrarian and it will certainly show. take a look at the html and you'll immediately realize i have no idea what i'm doing.
